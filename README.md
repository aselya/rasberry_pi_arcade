# rasberry_pi_arcade
This is a custom arcade in Java designed to run on a raspberry pi. It will be housed in an arcade cabinet that I plan to build

As of 11/27/18 this arcade consists of a login page, main menu and 2 games
It has password secured login and tracks the user's stats
details of how each component works are present in the comments of the code


Features that will be added in a future release:
Additional Games
More secure password storage
Additional Statistic tracking
Multiplayer over the net (long term)
